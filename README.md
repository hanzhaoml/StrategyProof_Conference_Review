## Compare Similarity Scores
1. To compare the similarity score with Divide-and-Rank partition and without:

``` > cd DivideClusters ```

``` > python compare_sim.py ```

2. To compute the similarity score with random partition: In the same folder run

``` > python compare_sim.py --compute_random```

## Use similarity matrix

The matrix is at ```iclr2018.npz```. Each line corresponds to an author and each column corresponds to a paper. The score between [0,1] represents the similarity.
